- Super Mario Land won't start.
- Synchronize the screen buffer so that there is no visual tearing.
- Finish going through test roms. Code currently fails 01 from Sound1 and Sound2.
- Sound during BIOS.
- Finish adding RTC support for MBC3.
- Move all emulator updates / rendering to another thread. Only handle events on the main thread.
- Find better solution to the component problem in the memory class. An array is used right now, but it sacrifices a memory footprint for a faster runtime. It should be possible to look up components based on address both quickly and compactly.
- GBC Improvements. GBC games can be run, but it is not well tested.
  + Double speed
  + Color rendering
  + GBC-specific initializations

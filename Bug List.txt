- Synchronize the screen buffer so that there is no visual tearing.
- Finish going through test roms. Code currently fails memory timing tests and 01 from Sound1 and Sound2.
  + Memory tests fail because we need to split instructions into multiple updates. E.g. For an 8 cycle
    instruction, we might have to do 4 cycles, then do another 4. Right now, the CPU just returns 8, but
	we would need more granularity.
- Sound during BIOS.
- Link's Awakening crash after 1st dungeon searching for BowWow.
- Pokemon Red title screen - background is 1 pixel off. Part of text moves with the pokemon sprite.
- Finish adding RTC support for MBC3.
- Consider putting ROM/RAM read stuff in MBC classes.
- Move timer code from Memory to its own unit.
- Move all emulator updates / rendering to another thread. Only handle events on the main thread.
- GBC Improvements. GBC games can be run, but it is not well tested.
  + Double speed
  + Color rendering
  + GBC-specific initializations
- Set up gitignore to ignore the contents of the build folder.
